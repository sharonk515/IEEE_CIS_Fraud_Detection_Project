Project Description
-----------------------
Imagine standing at the check-out counter at the grocery store with a long line behind you and the cashier not-so-quietly announces that your card has been declined. As you step aside, embarrassed, and allow the cashier to tend to the next customer, you receive a text message from your credit card company: "Press 1 if you really tried to spend $500 on cheddar cheese."

Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Computational Intelligence Society (IEEE-CIS) wants to improve this fraud prevention system and the customer experience, improving the efficacy of fradulent transaction alerts for people around the world and helping businesses reduce their fraud loss and increase their revenue. With higher accuracy fraud detection, you can get on with your snacks without the hassle.

The data used was provided by Vesta Corporation, the forerunner in guaranteed e-commerce payment solutions.
